      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Rob, and i’m a growing marketing & advertising professional.</p>
      <p>
        Throughout my coursework and growing professional experience, I've grown to love the process of 
        honing in on effective strategies - developing impactful campaigns and brands through strong 
        consumer and market insights. These experiences have taught me to be detail-oriented, creative, 
        and collaborative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies and internships, I’ve also developed strong skills in social media management, 
        content creation, and digital marketing. I have successfully managed social media accounts, 
        developed targeted marketing campaigns, and produced a wide array of media materials, including 
        media kits, video content, one-pagers, SOPs, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I possess strong communication and interpersonal skills that allow me to work well with others and 
        build strong relationships with clients and partners. I consider myself a quick learner and enjoy 
        working in a fast-paced environment where I can be creative and use my problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, you can find quality examples of project work & campaigns I’ve worked on within the past few years.
